# Covid-19-Detection-from-X-Ray-images-using-CNN

A Deep Learning Approach for the Detection of Covid-19 from Chest X-Ray Images using Convolutional Neural Networks.
Chest X-Ray is the first imaging technique that plays an important role in the diagnosis of Covid-19 disease. Computer vision and deep learning technique can help in determining COVID-19 virus with Chest X-Ray Images. 

# Python Libraries needed
1. PyQt5 : Understanding PyQt library . PyQt is a Graphical User Interface widgets toolkits. It works as a Python interface for Qt, one of the most prominent and famous cross-plateform GUI libraries. PyQt library was developed by RiverBank Computing Ltd.
2. numpy : Numerical Python . NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. Its adds powerful data structure to Python that guarantee efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices .
3. keras : Keras is the high-level API of TensorFlow . An approachable , highly-productive interface for solving machine learning problems, with a focus on modern deep learning.
4. tensorflow : TensorFlow is an open-sourse library developed by Google primarily for deep learning applications. It also supports traditional machine learning. 
5. opencv : OpenCV is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks. It is an open-source library that can be used to perform tasks like face detection , objection tracking, landmark detection, and much more.
6. imutils : This package includes a series of OpenCV + convenience functions that perform basics tasks such as translation , rotation , resizing , and skeletonization.
7. sklearn : Scikit-learn (SKlearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionally reduction via a consistence interface in python.
8. mahotas : Mahotas is a computer vision and image processing library for python. It is implemented using using C++ so it is fast and it operates over NumPy arrays. Currently, it has around 100 functions for computer vision and image processing and is ever-growing.
